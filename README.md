# Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
Master Research Project, University of Warwick 

The paper attached above ('Research Project.pdf') examines Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and sheds light on making machine learning models more interpretable. The current inability of humans to explain these models creates a barrier to the adoption of machine learning that becomes extremely problematic given the range of opportunities it creates for the society. To tackle this issue, this paper positions itself as a scientific guide for interpretability, filling in a major gap in the literature. More precisely, after setting the foundations for this concept, it provides a unified mathematical view of the current main explanation methods, which is vital to truly comprehend both the purpose and functioning of the technique utilised. This rigorous theoretical approach is then completed with an application on a customer churn use case for a telecom company. Its analysis illustrates how to implement, interpret and ideally combine these methods to obtain the best possible understanding of a real-world problem. Finally, to achieve an even more complete comprehension, this paper emphasises the need to search for some alternative approaches to the problem. In this case, survival analysis is chosen, applied and its theory expanded. 

This repository includes the code used to lead the customer churn study as well as its output. It acts as a complement to the paper 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)'. As partly suggested above, this analysis can be split into four distinct parts, namely : data visualisation, model construction, interpretation methods and survival analysis. 

The dataset regarded looks at fictitious customers who churned during the last month in the telecommunication company named Telco. The dataset was taken on IBM's website; it contains 7043 observations and 21 variables. Each row represents a unique client and each column contains information about his account (contract, payment method, etc.), his demography (gender, age, etc.) and his services (phone, multiple lines, internet, etc.). The exhaustive list of variables used in this analysis is included in Appendix C.
